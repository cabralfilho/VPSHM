# VPSHM
VPS Host Manager

# Usage
run `cd /tmp && wget -O installer wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platinumindustries/VPSHM/master/installer && sh installer`

Currently this only installs nodejs version 9.x . Does nothing else.
Will finish the script in due time to install and configure a full blown server like cPanel

NB: onlt tested on CentOS 7
